00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.010
Hi and welcome back to the course
translation workshop.

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.130
In this video, we'll learn what a flipped
course is and

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.970
why it's becoming an increasingly popular
teaching method.

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.210
By the end of the video you should be able
to explain what a flipped course is and

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.410
to discuss some of the advantages as well
as the challenges of flipping for

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.910
both you and your students.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.600
So first off, what is a flipped course?

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.400
Well, in a traditional course, students
come to class to hear lecture, and

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.040
then they do homework outside of class at
home.

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.280
In a flipped course, this is reversed.

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.830
So students watch lectures in video form
at home.

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.560
And then they come to class to apply what
they've learnt.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.040
So there are lots of different ways that
you can run a flipped course, but

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.550
here's what it might look like.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.750
So before class, students might be asked
to watch video lectures,

17
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.740
do assigned readings, maybe post to, a
course discussion board.

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.570
And then during class, they have the
opportunity to ask you,

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.260
the instructor, questions.

20
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.210
You have the opportunity to ask them
questions.

21
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.140
You can discuss or debate the material and
students can collaborate and

22
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.440
work in groups to solve problems, to
analyze cases, to do whatever makes

23
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.869
sense in your discipline to develop the
skills you want them to develop.

24
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.530
After class, then, students do individual
or group projects, or

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.510
structured reflections on what they've
learned to extend their learning,

26
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.100
to apply it in new contexts.

27
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.140
So, here's another way to think about it.

28
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.890
Before class, students learn the content.

29
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.230
During class, they apply the content.

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.130
And after class they extend their
learning.

31
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.810
So, there are a number of advantages of
flipping for your students.

32
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.860
First of all, when they watch lecture in
video form, they can rewind and

33
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.020
rewatch as often as they need to, until
they really get it.

34
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.109
That's something they can't do in a
classroom lecture.

35
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.340
Another advantage for

36
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.810
students is that then class time is freed
up for interaction.

37
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.070
Students can speak, they can discuss, they
can debate,

38
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.140
they can interact with one another.

39
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.990
And then finally this gives students the
opportunity to

40
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.640
get feedback from you when it's most
helpful,

41
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.809
when they're actually trying to solve
problems when they're working on things.

42
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.670
There are a number of advantages of
flipping for you as well.

43
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.770
First of all, you don't have to keep
prepping and

44
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.170
repeating the same lecture material.

45
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.880
You record it and it's done.

46
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.960
That way you can focus when you're with
students on your interactions with them,

47
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.710
and on providing coaching and

48
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.110
feedback, and responding more immediately
to their needs.

49
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.660
So while flipping has a number of
advantages both for

50
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.310
you and your students, it also has some
challenges.

51
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.580
For one thing, for you the distribution of
work changes.

52
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.460
You have to spend more time developing
video lectures and

53
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.450
classroom activities before the semester
begins.

54
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.710
But then you spend less time lecturing
once the semester is in progress.

55
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.710
Your role, in the classroom, also changes
in a flipped class so, during class,

56
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.900
rather than lecture, or kind of impart
information, your job is,

57
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.980
primarily, to coach as students work
through the material on their own.

58
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.110
And this can be wonderful, but

59
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.890
it's also a bit less predictable and
requires greater flexibility.

60
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.150
You have to think on your feet and

61
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.880
you have to respond to students' needs in
real time.

62
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.690
And that can take some getting used to.

63
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.490
Now, for students also, this kind of
learning can be challenging.

64
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.540
For one thing, when they come to class,
they can't be passive.

65
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.370
They have to participate.

66
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.110
And sometimes students long for

67
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.560
the anonymity and passivity of traditional
lectures.

68
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.840
So this takes some getting used to on
their part as well.

69
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.180
This isn't always an easy transition,
you'll need to be prepared.

70
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.690
You'll need to help students prepare, for
this different kind of learning.

71
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.140
And you should expect some time to adjust
but

72
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.760
I think in the end you're gonna enjoy it
this can be a really fun and

73
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.320
gratifying way to teach and can really
help students learn more and more deeply.

74
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.010
So, to summarize flipping reverses the
tasks that where

75
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.399
traditionally done inside and outside
class.

76
00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:42.530
It has a number of benefits for both you
and your students.

77
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.390
But it also requires some changes in roles
and

78
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.028
expectations and the distribution of work
until it becomes second nature.

79
00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:55.430
So if there's anything that we can help
you with, please let us know.

80
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.367
And stay in touch.
